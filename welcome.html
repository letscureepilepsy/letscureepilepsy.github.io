         <h1 id= "title3">How I discovered the CURE and learned of Epilepsy </h1>
        <p id="intro">To start off, let me introduce myself. My name is Antonia Rijo, and I am 14, almost 15, years old. To be completely honest, I had not really known of or thought about epilepsy until I had the great honor of attending a performance of the Broadway musical Hamilton in Chicago and was deeply amazed and intrigued by Miguel Cervantes, the extremely talented actor who played Alexander Hamilton. I even had the immense privelage of meeting Miguel Cervantes at the front of the theatre the following day by some sheer miracle, and he could not have been more kind or friendly. </p>  
        <p id= "body">Immediately after I returned home from Chicago, I discovered Miguel Cervantes's Instagram page.  The first picture I saw was an image that depicted Miguel Cervantes and a beautiful baby girl, who I would later understand to be his incredible daughter, Adelaide.  Miguel Cervantes was singing into a microphone in a recording room and his daughter could not have been more peaceful and calm as she rested in his arms.  After some quick research, I discovered that Miguel Cervantes's daughter was born with childhood epilepsy.  And, as a resut, Miguel Cervantes had partnered with Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy (CURE), a nonprofit orginization dedicated to discoverig a cure for epilepsy.  If the orginization succeeds in finding a cure, they will be capable of granting a miracle in the lives of the MILLIONS struggling with epilepsy. As I mentioned before, I had never really been introduced to epilepsy and was mostly unaware of its effects so, naturally, I did some research, wanting to bring to life a topic that had previously been hiding in the shadows of my life.  The more I learned of epilpesy, the more I wanted to help those affected.  If you are, like I was, a little uncertain about epilepsy, here is some information that I found because, before we can move on, you have to know what I'm raising awarness for! </p>
        
          
            
            <h2 id= "title2">Facts about Epilepsy </h2> 
            
           <p id= "fact1"> - An estimated 65 million people worldwide currently live with epilepsy.</p>
            <p id= "fact2">-One in 26 Americans will develop epilepsy in their lifetime.</p>
            <p id = "percent">-Epilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder in the United States after migraine, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. About one percent of Americans have some form of epilepsy, and nearly four percent (1 in 26) will develop epilepsy at some point in their lives.</p>
            <p id= "fact3">-Epilepsy can develop in any person at any age, but, as of late, especially in children around the age of one. </p>
            <p>-Almost 150,000 people in the U.S. develope epilepsy EVERY YEAR.</p>
            <p id= "fact4">-In definition, epilepsy is a neurological disorder marked by sudden recurrent episodes of sensory disturbance, loss of consciousness, or convulsions, associated with abnormal electrical activity in the brain.  Or, in simpler terms, epilepsy is a disorder in which nerve cell activity in the brain is disturbed which causes seizures.</p>
       
        <p id = "facts">-It is estimated that up to 50,000 deaths occur annually in the U.S. from status epilepticus (prolonged seizures), Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), and other seizure-related causes such as drowning and other accidents.
Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) accounts for 34% of all sudden deaths in children.
        
        </p>
        
            
            
           <p id= "fact5"> -And one of the facts that I found most shocking was the following: although epilepsy is among the most common neurological disorders and its associated economic costs are high, federal funding in epilepsy is MODEST and LAGS behind other common neurological conditions. Basically, this means that, in order to find a cure for epilepsy, the researchers NEED OUR HELP AND SUPPORT AND LOVE!! </p>
        
        
            <p id= "body2">
        
        </p>
        
        <p id="fact6">If you are still reading, thank you!  I truly belive that, with our help and support, the CURE will be able to find a cure for epilepsy.  I greatly encourage you to help and show your support for this cause if only to know that your efforts could put a huge smile on the face of a child who had previouly faced struggles you could hardly fathom...be the light in the darkness of another family's life.  Be the person who can look at the smiling faces of a mother and father and child and say: "I did that."

        <p id= "help"> I feel that it is common today for people to look at a problem or an obstacle and immediately deem that challenge too hard to overcome.  But, I belive, that if we work together, united in a common goal, anything is possible.  Together, WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  These families who have to live with epilepsy...I cannot imagine how much they have to fight.  I encourage you all to take up your sword and cape and join the fight to find a cure for epilepsy, for the Revolutionary War, or any war or fight for that matter, was not won by one strong individual, but by thousands and millions of people coming together to fight a united front.
    
        </p>
        
        <p id = "help2">One of the most important, yet simple, ways you can support the CURE is by raising awareness in ANY WAY YOU CAN!!  Get the word out into the world about this important cause!  Here are some ways you could spread the word!
        </p>
        
        <h7 id = "funds"> Ways we can spread the word</h7>
        
        <p id = "help3">-Hold a fundraiser event!  You can ask your school to hold an event that raises money for the CURE!  Or you can do something on your own!  For example, have a lemonade stand or a yard sale or any other stand to raise money.  Don't forget to spread awarness at the same time by letting your customers know for what amazing cause their money is helping. 
        </p>
        
        <p id="help4">-Spread the word with your voice and actions!  Tell friends and family and your community about the CURE and its mission; inspire them to take action.  Or, if you want to do something more quiet yet with equal impact, you could  make signs to put in your yard that say something like, "We support the CURE and you should too." Maybe you could even make t-shirts that are based on the CURE or create something unique and original that raises awareness for finding a cure for epilepsy!  Get creative!   
        </p>
    
        <p id= "help5">-Download Miguel Cervantes's song 'Til the Calm Comes!

        <h4 id = "title4"> Put it into Perspective
        
        </h4>
        
        <p id = "point"> I remember watching the video where Miguel and Kelly Cervantes told their story.  In the video, Kelly Cervantes said something along the lines of, "Living with epilepsy isn't something we want to do, but it is something we HAVE to do."  Hearing this line was like receiving a punch in the gut...I was indescribably shocked and even more saddened on behalf of those who have to suffer and endure as much pain and hardship as the Cervantes family does. And, as if this line wasn't heartbreaking enough, Miguel Cervantes said next, with tears in his eyes, "I don't feel like I have ever met her.  I look at her and just pray that she will look at me and smile.  And if there is a possibility that I may not get that, may never get to see that, and no one can help me find that...it makes me very sad."  Families living with epilepsy, they don't have a choice.  They are forced to live a life in fear of what the next hour, the next day will bring.  I cannot imagine what it must feel like to hold your child in your arms and wonder if they can even understand that you love them, comprehend that you are fighting as hard as you can for them.  I cannot imagine living in fear of what every minute, of what every second will bring and feeling the agonizing helplessness of not being capable of doing anything to immediately help the child in my arms.  But I do know that NO FAMILY SHOULD HAVE TO LIVE WITH THIS INCREDIBLE FEAR AND HARDSHIP.  Watching the Cervantes's story, I cried so much...they sounded so sad and so passionate.  I could hear their love for Adelaide in their voices.  I could see their pain and sadness in their tears.  I could read the fight in their eyes.  And I wanted to help.  And that is what I am trying to do.  There are so many families who are suffering and enduring just as much as the Cervantes family is.  There are TOO MANY families who have no choice but to persevere through the pain of epilepsy.  
        </p>
        
        
        <p id = "point2">With that being said, unlike those families living with the burden of epilepsy, we have a choice.  WE CAN CHOOSE TO HELP THOSE FAMILIES.  Please help me make their burdens lighter to carry.  We need to show those families that they are not standing in the middle of the stormy seas all alone; we need to let them know that we will be there, blowing the waves and storms away, being the light in their darkness.  TOGETHER WE CAN WIN THE BATTLE AGAINST EPILEPSY.  
        </p>
        
        <p id = "me">If I could tell those families who are struggling with epilepsy anything, I would tell them that THEY WILL GET THROUGH IT. I want to tell every single family that although you may feel like a lost sailor, caught in a seemingly never-ending storm of ominous waves and dark clouds with only a thin rope to grasp to keep you from plunging under the ocean, THE STORM WILL END.  Keep holding on and know that the clouds will be blown away and the seas will calm, but, for now, keep fighting to hold onto that rope.  And I want all of the families to know...I will keep fighting as hard as I can for you, for as long as it takes for the calm to come.</p>
